<p>Dr. <strong>Steve Finkbeiner</strong> 
is the Associate Director and Senior Investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease, the Director of the Taube/Koret Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, and a Professor of Neurology and Physiology at the University of California, San Francisco. 
He studies the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for learning, memory and neurodegeneration. 
A major focus of his work in the area of neurodegenerative disease has been the role of protein dyshomeostasis in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, and Frontotemporal dementia. 
In this context, he has developed a unique fully automated high throughput single cell analysis platform called robotic microscopy that provides very sensitive measures of phenotypes. Dr. Finkbeiner used his robotic microscope to resolve a long-standing puzzle in Huntington’s disease. A study based on results from the microscope became the most-cited paper in the field of neuroscience in the last decade.<font size="4">

         <strong> Abstract:</strong>  The beginning of the 21st century has seen a great renaissance in light microscopy in neuroscience, with new instruments and brain clearing and staining methods capable of generating complete datasets for the mouse brain at up to a submicron brainwide resolution. Here I will review the main pros and cons of the different types of the microscopy instrumentation and methods, and I will also describe our computational pipeline and toolchain software called Headlight for reconstruction, anatomical registration and computational analyses of the whole brain datasets. Finally, I will give examples of scientific applications from my lab at CSHL in systematic atlasing of cell-type distribution and morphology as well as from a biotech start-up Certerra focused on commercializing these methods for CNS drug screening.

         <p> <strong> Abstract:</strong> 
           Understanding the cellular changes that destine a neuron to live or to die is a fundamental challenge to understanding neurodegenerative disease. We use robotic microscopy, an imaging platform that uses automated identification and tracking of millions of individual neurons in culture over time, to quantitatively relate intermediate changes within a neuron to its fate. Interpreting changes within degenerating neurons is complicated both by the task of analyzing dense and complex microscopy images, as well as by the complication of analyzing progressive and often sporadic diseases. Using convolutional and recurrent neural networks, we quantify, interpret, and predict features in human patient derived neurons. These in silico methods reliably predict standard conventional cell-biological techniques, facilitate measurements that would be problematic or impossible to acquire using conventional methods, and outperform human manual curation. By surveying neurons derived from patients across neurodegenerative disease, we are developing algorithms for classifying unhealthy and diseased neurons across a variety of neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, we are able to reliably predict the life or death of a neuron prior to death, focusing our window for understanding the mechanisms for these progressive diseases. We believe the use of these technologies will enhance our understanding of the pathology and physiology underlying neurodegenerative diseases with the goal of creating new therapies and cures for these devastating diseases.

         <p>  <strong>Bio: </strong> 
        Dr. Jeremy Linsley is a postdoctoral fellow in Steve Finkbeiner’s lab in the Center for Systems and Therapeutics at the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California, San Francisco. Jeremy studies neurodegenerative disease models using four-dimensional imaging, novel fluorescent biosensors, and deep learning analysis. He combines artificial intelligence approaches with a fully automated robotic microscope developed by the Finkbeiner laboratory that can track individual cells for hours, days, or even months. Using these tools, he is developing cutting-edge technologies to detect, predict, and analyze a range neurodegenerative diseases. By shedding light on underlying pathology and physiology, Linsley’s work aims to create new therapies and cures for these devastating diseases. Linsley earned a PhD in molecular and cellular biology from the University of Michigan, where he studied a family of adaptor-like proteins. He explained the mechanism of action for one of the proteins in skeletal muscle and discovered that a mutation in one of the proteins was the basis for the debilitating Native American myopathy disease.

        <p> <strong> Abstract:</strong> With the advances in hardware and computational tools, large-scale high resolution volumetric imaging of whole systems is possible. Analysis of large volumes requires scalable segmentation algorithms and visualization platforms to efficiently stream through data and utilize user feedback. We developed an interactive segmentation and visualization framework for proofreading of large (tens of TBs) sparse volumetric datasets that aims to minimize user interaction with directed segmentation workflows. 
          Developed tools enabled the analysis and proofread of more than 500TBs of volumetric data and resulted in the largest axonal reconstruction database available(<a href="https://http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/">https:http://ml-neuronbrowser.janelia.org/</a>).
