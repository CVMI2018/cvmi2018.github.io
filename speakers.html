<p>Dr. <strong>Steve Finkbeiner</strong> is the Associate Director and Senior Investigator at the Gladstone Institute of Neurological Disease, 
  the Director of the Taube/Koret Center for Neurodegenerative Disease Research, and a Professor of Neurology and Physiology at the University of California, San Francisco.
  He studies the molecular mechanisms that are responsible for learning, memory and neurodegeneration. 
  A major focus of his work in the area of neurodegenerative disease has been the role of protein dyshomeostasis in Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS, and Frontotemporal dementia. 
  In this context, he has developed a unique fully automated high throughput single cell analysis platform called robotic microscopy that provides very sensitive measures of phenotypes. 
  Dr. Finkbeiner used his robotic microscope to resolve a long-standing puzzle in Huntingtonâ€™s disease.
  A study based on results from the microscope became the most-cited paper in the field of neuroscience in the last decade.</p>

<p>Dr. <strong>Michelle Freund</strong> 
   is Scientific Program Coordinator in the Office of Technology Development and Coordination at the National Institute of Mental Health, NIH, Bethesda, MD. As a program officer, she manages a research portfolio of grants that are focused on the development of novel tools and technologies important for the advancement of basic and translational neuroscience. 
  Michelle serves as the Director for the NIH NeuroBioBank, a network of six brain and tissue repositories that provide post-mortem human brain samples for research. She is an active member of several trans-NIH interdisciplinary teams such as the NIH BRAIN Initiative and the Blueprint for Neuroscience. As co-lead on a BRAIN Initiative team, she provides guidance and oversight for the Cells and Circuits focus area outlined in the BRAIN 2025 report. Michelle received a B.A. from the University of California, San Diego in mammalian physiology and a Ph.D. in Neuroscience from Hahnemann University in Philadelphia. 
  Before joining NIH in 2007, she studied the role of monoamine neurotransmitters in the actions of antidepressant drugs and the interactions of stress and drug addiction.

 <p>  Dr. <strong>Pavel Osten </strong> 
   received his MD degree from the Medical School of Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic, and his Ph.D. from the State University of New York, HSCB. 
   He is currently Associate Professor at the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory and founder of Certerra, a company that is working at the interface of systems neuroscience and automated microscopy, and knowledge. His research interests include the development of viral vector-based methods for gene therapy applications, with a particular focus on targeting of cell type-specific neurons and identified neuronal networks, and the study of gene and cellular functions underlying the contributions of individual neurons and defined networks to cognitive performance. 
   In 2005, he was the recipient of a Wellcome Trust Senior Fellowship.

    <p>  Dr. <strong>Jie Yang </strong> is a Program Director in the Division of Information and Intelligent Systems (IIS) at the National Science Foundation (NSF).
      He is the leader of the Robust Intelligence Cluster and oversees computer vision research. He has also been involved in many other crosscutting programs. Before joining NSF, he was a faculty member in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon University, where he worked on multimodal/multimedia, computer vision, pattern recognition, robotics, and automatic control. He was an Advisory Board member of the ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces (2003-2015). He also served as Program Co-chair (2002) and General Co-chair (2006 and 2010) for ACM International Conference on Multimodal Interfaces, as well as a Program Co-chair (2010) for ACM Multimedia. He served as a General Co-chair (2014) for the IEEE International Conference on Multimedia & Expo. He served as an Associate Editor for the IEEE Transaction on Multimedia (2004-2008).  He is an Associate Editor for the Machine Vision Applications journal. He also served as Area Chair and Program Committee member for multimodal/multimedia, computer vision, and pattern recognition conferences. He is a fellow of IEEE.
